<ul>
<li>The open question that: whether a black hole can become tidally deformed by an external gravitational field has profound implications for fundamental physics, astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. Love tensors characterize the tidal deformability of compact objects such as astrophysical (Kerr) black holes under an external static tidal field. This work proves that all Love tensors vanish identically for a Kerr black hole in the nonspinning limit or for an axisymmetric tidal perturbation. In contrast to this result, Love tensors are generically <em>nonzero</em> for a spinning black hole.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>The short wavelength lensed GWs (ignoring wave effects) have phase shifts that are typically degenerate with either a shift in the coalescence phase or a detector and inclination dependent shift in the orientation angle. However, the presence of precession or eccentricity and higher harmonic modes would break this degeneracy. An exact template with a phase shift in Fourier space can always be constructed to fit any lensed image. The authors conclude that an optimal strong lensing search strategy would incorporate phase information in all stages of the identification of strong-lensing, with an exact treatment in the final assessment of the probability of multiple lensed events. This work clarifies the role that strong lensing plays in the phase evolution of GWs: how it can lead to apparent deviations from GR, how it can affect the detectability of GW events, and how it can be exploited to help identify cases of strong gravitational lensing of gravitational wave sources.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA, will detect gravitational wave signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar mass compact object orbits a supermassive black hole and eventually plunges into it. This paper reports on LISA's capability to detect whether the smaller compact object in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral is endowed with a scalar field, and to measure its scalar charge-a dimensionless quantity that acts as a measure of how much scalar field the object carries. By direct comparison of signals, the authors show that LISA will be able to detect and measure the scalar charge with an accuracy of the order of per cent, which is an unprecedented level of precision. This result is independent unprecedented level of precision. This result is independent of the origin of the scalar field and of the structure and other properties of the small compact object, so it can be seen as fundamental fields.</p></li>
<li><p>An EMRI in which the secondary object (which can be a neutron star, a black hole or something more exotic) moves in the spacetime generated by the primary body and is endowed with a massless scalar field configuration, in a local reference frame <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\}\)</span> centred on the secondary body, has the scalar field with the form: <span class="math display">\[
\varphi=\varphi_{0}+\frac{\mu d}{\tilde{r}}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\mu^{2}}{\tilde{r}^{2}}\right)

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\dot{E}_{\text {grav }}\)</span> is the gravitational flux. The scalar flux affects the orbital evolution of the secondary body.

<ul>
<li><p>The sky-averaged redshifted 21 cm absorption line of neutral hydrogen is a probe of the cosmic dawn - when star formation commenced in the first collapsed objects, is predicted to be revealed by spectral and spatial signatures in the cosmic radio background at long wavelengths. The line profile is determined by the evolving thermal state of the gas, radiation background, Lyman α radiation from stars scattering off cold primordial gas, and relative populations of the hyperfine spin levels in neutral hydrogen atoms. The paper reports a radiometer measurement of the spectrum of the radio sky in the 55–85 MHz band, which shows that the profile found by Bowman et al could be bore out and suggests that the profile found by Bowman et al. is not evidence for new astrophysics or non-standard cosmology.</p></li>

<li><p>"We have used this distribution of profile parameters and generated a substantially larger number of MCMC walkers by allowing for an additional scale factor parameter for each of their profiles. We then evolved the walkers for each profile, using a sixth-order polynomial to represent the foreground and calibration systematics in this sky spectrum, to model the SARAS 3 spectrum. The analysis for each walker thus followed the same method as described in the main text for the best-fitting profile of Bowman et al. <span class="math inline">\(^{5}\)</span>. The scale factor distributions from our suite of walkers, considering all of the walkers for all of the profiles together, are naturally weighted by the likelihood distribution defined by the data from the EDGES instrument, and constrained by the data from SARAS 3. The scale factors from all walkers, combined to form a single distribution, have the distribution shown in Extended Data Fig. 9b. The mean scale factor is <span class="math inline">\(0.07\)</span> and the profile set found by Bowman et al. <span class="math inline">\(^{5}\)</span> as a whole is rejected with <span class="math inline">\(90.4 \%\)</span> confidence. In Extended Data Fig. <span class="math inline">\(9 c\)</span> we display the distribution of most-likely scale factors corresponding to each of the profiles in Extended Data Fig. 9a, showing that the scale factor is not consistent with unity for any of the profiles, and is therefore disfavoured by the SARAS 3 data. In Extended Data Fig. 10 we show the distribution of rejection confidence in the profile parameter space."</p></li>

<li><p>For the solution of the Einstein equations we adopt the covariant and conformal formulation of the <span class="math inline">\(Z 4\)</span> equations (CCZ4). We recall that the <span class="math inline">\(Z 4\)</span> formulation can be obtained from the covariant Lagrangian <span class="math display">\[
\Lambda=g^{\mu \nu}\left(R_{\mu \nu}+2 \nabla_{\mu} Z_{\nu}\right) \sqrt{-g}+\Lambda_{m}
\]</span> by means of a Palatini-type variational principle, where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the metric determinant. The variational principle yields the field equations <span class="math display">\[
R_{\mu \nu}+\nabla_{\mu} Z_{\nu}+\nabla_{\nu} Z_{\mu}=8 \pi\left(T_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} T g_{\mu \nu}\right)
\]</span> as well as a set of constraints fixing the connection <span class="math display">\[
\nabla_{\mu} g^{\mu \nu}=0
\]</span> and the algebraic constraint <span class="math display">\[
Z_{\mu}=0 \text {. }
\]</span> The key idea of the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Z} 4\)</span> formalism is to develop a set of evolution equations starting from the Lagrangian, without explicitly enforcing, i.e. treating <span class="math inline">\(Z_{\mu}\)</span> as a new independent variable. The resulting set of equations is then strongly hyperbolic, i.e. free from the zero-speed modes of the original ADM system, and the solution of the Einstein equations is obtained exploiting the fact that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Z} 4\)</span> evolution system preserves the constraint, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{t}\left(Z_{\mu}\right)=0\)</span>. In particular, if the initial-data is constraint satisfying, the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Z} 4\)</span> evolution recovers the solution of the Einstein equations, even though <span class="math inline">\(Z_{\mu}\)</span> is an evolved variable. In practice, however, small numerical errors introduce constraint violation during the evolution, for this reason the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Z} 4\)</span> system is usually modified, with the addition of terms that cancel out in the case in which the constraints are satisfied, to ensure that eventual constraint violations are propagated away and damped exponentially.</p>
<p>The version of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Z} 4\)</span> is based on a conformal decomposition of the original Z4 system and aims at exploiting well-tested gauge conditions together with the constraint propagation and damping properties of the original Z4 formulation. The CCZ4 system then reads: <span class="math display">\[

<ul>
<li><p>GW170817 placed an upper bound on certain parameters describing the binary’s tidal interactions. By showing the interpretation of the UV/optical/infrared counterpart of GW170817 with kilonova models with the associated new numerical relativity results, this paper implies a complementary lower bound on the tidal deformability parameter. The joint constraints tentatively rule out both extremely stiff and soft NS equations of state. In this <em>Letter</em> the authors propose and apply to GW170817 a new approach that combines optical/infrared and GW observations, by means of new numerical relativity results, to derive strong joint constraints on the tidal deformability of NSs.</p></li>
<li><p>Presently, the strongest con- straint comes from the fact that the maximum mass for NSs must be larger than about <span class="math inline">\(2 M_{\odot}\)</span> .</p></li>

<li><p>These results show that numerical relativity simulations are key to exploiting the potential of multimessenger observations. While GW data bounds the tidal deformability of NSs from above, the EM data and our simulations bound it from below. The result is a competitive constraint already after the first detection of a merger event. This method is general, it can be applied to future observations and used to inform the priors used in the GW data analysis. The authors anticipate that, with more observations and more precise simulations, the bounds on the tidal deformability of NSs will be further improved.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>This work presents THC: a new high-order flux-vector-splitting code for Newtonian and special-relativistic hydrodynamics designed for direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows. This work also shows the first systematic comparison of these schemes in Newtonian physics as well as for special-relativistic flows.</p></li>
<li><p>Numerical relativistic hydrodynamics has come a long way since the pioneering works by May &amp; White (1966) and Wilson (1972) and it is now playing a central role in <u>modelling of systems involving strong gravity and/or flows with high Lorentz factors</u>. Example of applications are relativistic jets, core-collapse supernovae, merger of compact binaries and the study of gamma-ray bursts [see Mart ́ı &amp; Mu ̈ller (2003) and Font (2008) for a complete overview].</p>
<p>In all of these areas the progress has been continuous over the past few years to the point that <u>relativistic computational fluid dynamics is starting to provide a realistic description of many relativistic-astrophysics scenarios</u> [see, e.g. Rezzolla et al. (2011)]. Key factors in this progress have been the switch to more advanced and accurate numerical schemes, and <u>in particular the adoption of high resolution shock capturing (HRSC) schemes</u> (Martí et al. 1991; Schneider et al. 1993; Banyuls et al. 1997; Donat et al. 1998; Aloy et al. 1999; Baiotti et al. 2003) and the progressive inclusion of more "physics" for a more accurate description of the different scenarios. Examples of the latter are the inclusion of magnetic fields (Koide et al. 1999; Del Zanna et al. 2003; Gammie et al. 2003; Komissarov 2004; Duez et al. 2005; Neilsen et al. 2006; Antón et al. 2006; Giacomazzo &amp; Rezzolla 2007) the use of realistic tabulated equations of state, [see, e.g. Sekiguchi et al. (2011)], and the description of radiative processes (Farris et al. 2008; Sekiguchi 2010; Zanotti et al. 2011).</p>
<p><u>==The development of more accurate numerical tools for relativistic hydrodynamics is an active and lively field of research. Most of the effort has been directed towards the development of high-order finite-volume (Tchekhovskoy et al. 2007; Duffell &amp; MacFadyen 2011) and finite-difference (Zhang &amp; MacFadyen 2006; Del Zanna et al. 2007) schemes, but many alternative approaches have been also proposed, including finite-element methods (Mann 1985; Meier 1999), spectral methods (Gourgoulhon 1991), smoothedparticle-hydrodynamics (Siegler &amp; Riffert 2000; Rosswog 2010) and discontinuous Galerkin methods (Dumbser &amp; Zanotti 2009; Radice &amp; Rezzolla 2011).==</u></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, THC represents the first step towards the implementation of new and high-order methods for the accurate study of general-relativistic problems, such as the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars (Baiotti et al. 2011) and their relation with gamma-ray bursts (Rezzolla et al. 2011). In fact, the transition towards higher-order methods is now a necessary and an inevitable step for a more realistic description of the complex phenomenology associated with these relativistic-astrophysics processes.</p></li>

<li><p>This paper combines gravitational wave <span class="math inline">\((\mathrm{GW})\)</span> and electromagnetic <span class="math inline">\((\mathrm{EM})\)</span> data to perform a Bayesian parameter estimation of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817. The EM likelihood is constructed from a fit to a large number of numerical relativity simulations in which a lower bound on the mass of the remnant's accretion disk is inferred from the modeling of the EM light curve. In comparison with previous works, this analysis yields a more precise determination of the tidal deformability of the binary, for which the EM data provide a lower bound, and of the mass ratio of the binary, with the EM data favoring a smaller mass asymmetry.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GW}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{EM}\)</span> data to be independent, we can write the joint <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GW}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{EM}\)</span> likelihood as the product of the separate likelihoods, namely <span class="math display">\[

<ul>
<li><p>This paper presents an all-sky <span class="math inline">\(90 \%\)</span> confidence level upper limit on the cosmic flux of relativistic magnetic monopoles using 2886 days of IceCube data. The analysis was optimized for monopole speeds between <span class="math inline">\(0.750 c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.995 c\)</span>, without any explicit restriction on the monopole mass. This work constrains the flux of relativistic cosmic magnetic monopoles to a level below <span class="math inline">\(2.0 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{sr}^{-1}\)</span> over the majority of the targeted speed range. This result constitutes the most strict upper limit to date for magnetic monopoles with <span class="math inline">\(\beta \gtrsim 0.8\)</span> and up to <span class="math inline">\(\beta \sim 0.995\)</span> and fills the gap between existing limits on the cosmic flux of nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic magnetic monopoles.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnetic monopoles could have formed in the early Universe as the temperature of the primordial plasma dropped below the energy scale of the GUT symme- try breaking.</p>
<p>Relativistic monopoles (defined as those with <span class="math inline">\(\beta \geq\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(0.750\)</span> in what follows) will induce Cherenkov radiation when traversing a dielectric medium faster than the speed of light in the medium, as electrically charged particles do. Therefore Cherenkov detectors can be used to search for cosmic monopoles through the pattern they would leave when passing through the detector.</p>
<p>IceCube is a cubic-kilometer array of digital optical modules (DOMs) deployed in 86 strings at depths between <span class="math inline">\(1.45\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2.45 \mathrm{~km}\)</span> below the surface of the glacial ice at the South Pole. IceCube uses the ice both as target and detection medium to detect the Cherenkov light from secondary particles produced in neutrino interactions, but it is also sensitive to searches for any new particle that can produce light that is detectable by the optical modules.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) recently measured the mass and equatorial radius of the isolated neutron star PSR J0030+0451. The authors use these measurements to infer the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, and the surface eccentricity of an isolated neutron star for the first time. Combining this information with the measurement of the tidal Love number with LIGO/Virgo observations, the authors propose and implement the first theory-agnostic and equation-of-state- insensitive test of general relativity. Specializing these constraints to a particular modified theory, the authors find that consistency with general relativity places the most stringent constraint on gravitational parity violation to date, surpassing all other previously reported bounds by 7 orders of magnitude and opens the path for a future test of general relativity with multimessenger neutron star observations.</p></li>
<li><p>When properly nondimensionalized, the moment of inertia <span class="math inline">\((I)\)</span>, the rotational quadrupole moment <span class="math inline">\((Q)\)</span>, and the tidal Love number <span class="math inline">\((\lambda)\)</span> of neutron stars show a remarkable degree of equation-of-state insensitivity, at a level below <span class="math inline">\(1 \%[4,5]\)</span>. These "I-Love-Q" relations also exist in some modified theories of gravity, although they are different from their general relativity counterparts.</p></li>
<li><p>Since carrying out such a test on a theory-by-theory basis would, in general, be complicated, the authors develop and implement a useful parametrization of the I-Love test. From Newtonian gravity, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{I}\)</span> scales with <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{-2}\)</span>, whereas <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\lambda}\)</span> scales with <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{-5}\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{I}=C_{\bar{I}} \bar{\lambda} \bar{\lambda}^{2 / 5}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(C_{\bar{I}} \bar{\lambda} \approx 0.52\)</span> a constant that depends on the equation of state very weakly. This calculation can be extended, systematically, in a post-Minkowskian expansion, i.e., an expansion in powers of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C} \ll 1\)</span>. The outcome is that both <span class="math inline">\(\bar{I}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\lambda}\)</span> can be written as a power series in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and then be combined (as just described in the Newtonian limit) to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\bar{I}=\bar{I}(\bar{\lambda})\)</span>. The resulting I-Love relation has the same degree of equation-of-state independence as the original I-Love relation. For the neutron star catalog, a parametrization in general relativity of the form <span class="math display">\[
\bar{I}_{\mathrm{GR}}=\bar{\lambda}^{2 / 5}\left(c_{0}+c_{1} \bar{\lambda}^{-1 / 5}+c_{2} \bar{\lambda}^{-2 / 5}\right)
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(c_{0}=0.584, c_{1}=0.980, c_{2}=2.695\)</span>, is sufficient to reproduce our numerical data with mean relative error <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle\epsilon^{\bar{I}}\right\rangle \leq 2 \times 10^{-3}\)</span>. The prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\lambda}^{2 / 5}\)</span> is the Newtonian result, while the powers of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\lambda}^{-1 / 5}\)</span> inside parenthesis are relativistic (post-Minkowskian) corrections because <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\lambda}^{-1 / 5} \propto \mathcal{C} \lesssim 0.2\)</span>. Given this, we then propose a minimal deformation of the Einsteinian parametrization in above equation of the form <span class="math display">\[
\bar{I}_{\mathrm{p}}=\bar{I}_{\mathrm{GR}}+\beta \bar{\lambda}^{-b / 5}, \quad \beta \in \mathbb{R}_{+}, \quad b \in \mathbb{Z},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are deformation parameters that control the magnitude and type of the deviations from general relativity in the I-Love relation, respectively. Such a parametrization is similar to that successfully used in gravitational-wave tests of general relativity by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration, the parametrized post-Einsteinian framework.</p></li>

<li>The authors present dynesty, a public, open-source, Python package to estimate Bayesian posteriors and evidences (marginal likelihoods) using Dynamic Nested Sampling. By adaptively allocating samples based on posterior structure, Dynamic Nested Sampling has the benefits of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms that focus exclusively on posterior estimation while retaining Nested Sampling’s ability to estimate evidences and sample from complex, multi-modal distributions. We provide an overview of Nested Sampling, its extension to Dynamic Nested Sampling, the algorithmic challenges involved, and the various approaches taken to solve them. We then examine dynesty’s performance on a variety of toy problems along with several astronomical applications. We find in particular problems dynesty can provide substantial improvements in sampling efficiency compared to popular MCMC approaches in the astronomical literature.</li>

<li>Supermassive black hole (BH) binaries are thought to produce self-lensing flares (SLFs) when the two BHs are aligned with the line of sight. If the binary orbit is observed nearly edge-on, the relativistic shadow around the background BH can be found. By ray tracing in a binary model, the authors predict that 1% of the current binary candidates could show this feature. This BH tomography method proposed here could make it possible to extract BH shadows that are spatially unresolvable by high-resolution very long base line interferometry (VLBI).</li>

Their circumbinary disk that transfers material to two minidisks, each orbiting one BH compo- nent.
